# H.I.M
## What exactly is H.I.M: 
Health Indicative Monitor acronymed H.I.M is a intelligent cognitive medical assistance that will assist people to diagnose their symptoms and predict what problem the user might be having. By no means is this a tool aimed to replace doctors but it will just be a tool for people to quickly guess what problem they might have and will ultimately recommend a doctor for the same.

## What we aspire to achieve:
We sincerely believe HealthCare is a fundamental right and a basic amenity that should be available to one and all. This product is specifically aimed to serve economically weaker strata of the society who can not run to a doctor and pay 500 bucks for every time they get a headache. There is a Multilingual voice interaction feature available so as make the chat box more inclusive and a global product.
  
## Working of H.I.M: 
We have a simple chat box in form of a webApp where users can enter their query i.e the type of discomfort they are feeling or the health issue they are currently undergoing and the bot will then ask a series of queries to the users and based on the answer given by the user it will at the end predict what disease a user might have. A demo working of the chat box is given below:

>>>USER : Hi.

>>>H.I.M : Hi there. Good morning. How can i help you?

>>> USER : I have severe cough and cold for 2-3 days now

>>>H.I.M : Do you also have fever?

>>>USER : Yes i do.

>>>H.I.M : Would you say you also have diarrhea? 

>>>USER : Yes.

>>>H.I.M : Do you feel any muscle fatigue?

>>>USER : Not really..

>>>H.I.M : Have you had any headaches?

>>>USER : yes,sometimes.

>>>H.I.M : Do you feel pukish or have you vomited in the past 2-3 days?

>>>USER : Yes

>>>H.I.M : On a cursory reading it seems you might have Typhoid. But then I am sometimes wrong and I sincerely hope you are completely okay and will get well soon. It is highly recommended that you consult a physician immediately. Would you like me too book an            appointment for you?


>>>USER : No Thanks. 

>>>H.I.M : Okay. Have a good day. 


## Additional Functionality:
  
Speech Interaction : The entire conversation can be done in a voice based approach.

Multilingual voice interaction : Since this chat box is specifically designed for people from the economically weaker section of the society we have also taken into account the fact that people might not be very comfortable in english. And we sincerely believe that language should not be a barrier to a getting a fundamental right such as healthcare. So keeping this in mind we have added the functionality that the user can interact in a language other than english also. For now we have added only Hindi but it can very easily be extended for any other language.


## Things We are trying very hard to Incorporate:

Can Suggest Medicines

Can show doctors nearby and book appointment.
